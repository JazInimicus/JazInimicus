#Hello there!

I'm Jaz, a 22 year old programmer from Germany. Currently I am studying Business Informatics at "FH Aachen University of applied science".
I studied two semesters of computer science before hand but decided to switch to business informatics since I find it a tad more interesting.

Here on my GitHub I upload some of my school work but mostly hobby projects I do in my freetime.
So you can expect some cool (and sometimes silly) projects in the future :D
