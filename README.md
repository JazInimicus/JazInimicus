# Hello there!

I'm Jaz, a 22 year old programmer from Germany. Currently I am studying Business Informatics at "FH Aachen University of applied science".
I studied two semesters of computer science before hand but decided to switch to business informatics since I find it a tad more interesting.

Here on my GitHub I upload some of my school work but mostly hobby projects I do in my freetime.
So you can expect some cool (and sometimes silly) projects in the future :D


## Current Projects I am working on or plan to work on:
**The Simp Game**
A simple text adventure game I am doing to have something silly to laugh about with friends

**Book Database**
Since I have a lot of books that I want to keep track of, I want to make a little program were I can put all the information of those books 
and search for them. Also I want this to be a first test of doing my first GUI.

**Organised Writing**
A bigger project that I will start when I got a better and deeper understanding of C++ and how to write a GUI. 
Basically I want a small programm where I can input all the information about my worlds and characters, maybe even write in there, just like in Shaxpir or Scrivener.
